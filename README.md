Joomla! gzip control
===================


Need some control over the compressed output of Joomla! ?

Look no further.

By default this plugin disables the gzip compression of the html output of your Joomla! site for the User Agents of Facebook and LinkedIn (those are the BOTs that scan your site everytime someone posts a link to Facebook or LinkedIn).

Also you can specify easily your own User Agents (BOTs most of the time) that feel happier with plain uncompressed html!


For example on the Plugin's setup page you can type:

```
Firefox|IOS
```
and you just disabled the compression on the matching devices/browsers. Seperate differnt User Agents with "|".

Report any bugs, or funky problems!

Have fun.
